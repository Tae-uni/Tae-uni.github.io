## Continuous Integration(CI) & Continuous Deployment(CD)

### What is CI?
Continuous integration (CI) is a software practice that requires frequently committing code to a shared repository. Committing code more often detects errors sooner and reduces the amount of code a developer needs to debug when finding the source of an error.

### What is CD?
Continuous deployment (CD) is the practice of using automation to publish and deploy software updates. As part of the typical CD process, the code is automatically built and tested before deployment.

### GitHub Actions
GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test and deployment pipeline. You can create workflows that build and test every pull request to your repository, or deploy merged pull requests to production.
